						<p class="vol-speak--items--desc">&quot;I have wondered, more than once, for being a part in Aasya. Because, as it was a screen of many lives pictured together for building an ideal society. I used to think of being passionate about service, but now I am so grateful to work with people, whose passion is all about service. My experience in Aasya from past one year made me to be strong in and out, helped me to increase my dedication levels, team spirit, ethical values and leadership qualities. I used to fell myself for tiny problems. But, after going through the fades of many life shadows. I made myself strong enough to face any situation..!! If I could sum up my experience in Aasya, I would say that it was a life changing step of mine.&quot;</p><strong class="vol-speak--items--desc--tag-line">- Srinithya, <br/>Hyderabad, Telangana</strong>

						<p class="vol-speak--items--desc">&quot;I am writing this piece to share my love and regards to the Aasya foundation, a student run NGO dedicated to fight back and help the people affected with different kind of diseases; financially, emotionally and psychologically.&quot;</p>
						<p class="vol-speak--items--desc">&quot;Aasya Foundation provides Health Care services to the underserved people of India.&quot;</p>
						<p class="vol-speak--items--desc">&quot;I, Meghana N, with the recommendation of my friend, joined this organization as a Joint Secretary while I was still pursuing my engineering. The idea of serving the needy and to let myself dissolve in the actions that consequently provide joy to this community, I was moved to join this Non-Profit Organization.&quot;</p>
						<p class="vol-speak--items--desc">&quot;While my way in, I was delighted to meet Mr. Nagarjuna who is the President of this Foundation and the one that shared the vision of his initiatives. A profound leader as he is, not only did he inspired people, he led my spirit to have an absolute zeal towards helping and serving the society.&quot;</p>
						<p class="vol-speak--items--desc">&quot;During my visit to one of Aasya Foundation‚Äôs finest events at the Thara Orphanage, where we celebrated our 2nd Anniversary, I met so many children living under the supervision of Vishnu, who also grew up as an orphan in the same orphanage. Seeing them smile for a moment, I could not contemplate how I must feel. Even though they had no parents they were content, playful and happy.&quot;</p>
						<p class="vol-speak--items--desc">&quot;On this day, the kids and I had long chats, we had fun, we studied, and in the afternoon when it was time for lunch, Fruits and chocolates were distributed. We also had a family that visited the orphanage and they wanted to celebrate their child‚Äôs birthday. It was a pleasant experience having all these people around but the best part was when the members of Aasya Foundation and I were so engaged in our own responsibilities and duties that we did not realize we haven‚Äôt eaten anything since morning until Vishnu came to me offering me a banana. I asked him ‚ÄúIf I eat this banana what will you eat then?‚Äù&quot;</p>
						<p class="vol-speak--items--desc">&quot;He replied softly ‚ÄúSister, the way you treated us with so much love and patience today, I haven‚Äôt felt or seen it before. I see my mother in you. You treated me and the others like your own kids‚Äù&quot;</p>
						<p class="vol-speak--items--desc">&quot;I had no words. This child just entitled me as his mother. My heart was filled with a vague feeling of accomplishment that I didn‚Äôt understand. And ever since I rejoice this moment.&quot;</p>
						<p class="vol-speak--items--desc">&quot;I told Vishnu that it was the best thing I have ever heard. I replied to him saying ‚ÄòI will always love you kid and we will miss you‚Äô and he cutely replied back saying ‚Äúme too‚Äù&quot;</p>
						<p class="vol-speak--items--desc">&quot;Gazing at his expression my eyes were blurred with droplets of tears and I couldn‚Äôt have felt happier from that day onward. It was literally the best moment of my life.&quot;</p>
						<p class="vol-speak--items--desc">&quot;And then while we departed, he insisted that I visit the orphanage again with my team, to spend time with the children and while we were leaving, he started crying&quot;</p>
						<p class="vol-speak--items--desc">&quot;Honestly, of all the relations with people in this country, the bond with Vishnu was realest and officially the best since date. I want to go back!&quot;</p><strong class="vol-speak--items--desc--tag-line">- Meghana N, <br/>Hyderabad, Telangana</strong>

						<p class="vol-speak--items--desc">&quot;My self Prashanth marry i am Proud being  a part of Aasya foundation. From my childhood I had a special interest in helping needy. One Fine day, through my friend I came to know about Aasya foundation and its  humble activities.Initially I felt shy to interact with people,also I'm  not so good in regional language Tamil. Later on It changed my mindset by actively participating in Aasya events.&quot;</p>
						<p class="vol-speak--items--desc">&quot;When i attended for the very first event in 'Little hearts'. I felt so happy and overwhelmed with joy. Along with the people in Little hearts we also danced and enjoyed a lot. Few such moments come only once in a life.&quot;</p>
						<p class="vol-speak--items--desc">&quot;We have completed five other events and the sixth event was 'MAHI' tree plantation.  This Initiative was taken  to plant trees on our team member birthdays . I was given the responsibility to lead this event. I like to thank my Team Aasya Coimbatore for trusting me and for giving me this oppurtunity to lead a event. It was not quiet easy to lead a event. It involves a lots of efforts because if we  work hard; Success comes to our door step. By being a lead for a event , It taught me a lot of things Such as, How to create interest in people to attend the event, How to plan, and Execute the plan. Through this Event I have learnt to overcome my fear. In the name of Aasya foundation, we brought hopes in many lifes. Being a volunteer in Aasya foundation I have learnt to respect people, knowing their needs,sharing words with them. I Am so blessed to do these kind of activities with love. .It also improved my communication skills.&quot;</p>
