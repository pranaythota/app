						<li class="pp__list__item">To sell advertising space on the site and personalised adverts. This helps us to keep the site free for people who visit it</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="pp__desc">In summary, we might use your information to:</p>
					<ul class="pp__list">
						<li class="pp__list__item">Remember when you visit our websites and track your browsing patterns by using cookies</li>

						<li class="pp__list__item">Communicate with you by email, post, telephone, sms text message, social media or mobile push message to let you know about any of our products, services or promotions (which, in some cases may be provided by third parties) but only according to the permissions you give us</li>
						<li class="pp__list__item">Ensure materials on our sites and applications are presented in the most effective manner for you and your computer or mobile device</li>
						<li class="pp__list__item">Collate and log numeric internet addresses to improve our sites and to monitor site usage. This allows us to assess and understand customer feedback and identify usage hotspots</li>
					</ul>
					<h4 class="pp__heading__secondary">The legal basis for processing your Personal Data</h4>
					<p class="pp__desc">In order to comply with applicable data protection laws, we are required to set out the legal basis for processing your Personal Data. In accordance with the purposes for which we collect and use your Personal Data, as set out above, the legal basis for processing your personal data will typically be one of the following:</p>

						<li class="pp__list__item">Compliance with our legal obligations</li>
					</ul>
					<h4 class="pp__heading__secondary">Our Values</h4>
					<p class="pp__desc">We may occasionally contact you with information or questions about your registration, your subscription account or postings, for example, with reminders, warnings or copyright requests.</p>
					<p class="pp__desc">We will be clear in our dealings with you as to what information we will collect about you and how we will use it.</p>
					<p class="pp__desc">Our sites are accessible via the internet. This means that people around the world who access our sites will be able to see anything you post on the sites, for example, comments about an article. We require all those who post comments upon our sites to abide by the spirit and letter of our house rules. If, for example, you were to write a defamatory comment on one of our articles we may be required by a court to disclose your personal data.</p>
					<p class="pp__desc">You have the right to ask us not to use your personal data for marketing purposes. You can request that you stop receiving information from us at any time by emailing us at aasyafoundation.org</p>
					<p class="pp__desc">We invest in high-quality security and do our utmost to protect user privacy. The password you provide when registering with our sites is encrypted to ensure protection against unauthorised access to your personal data. However, it is worth remembering that no data transmission over the Internet can be entirely secure and therefore we cannot guarantee the security of your personal data and/or use of our site. Any information that you send is at your own risk and may be read by others. However, once we have received your personal data we use strict procedures to protect the security of your personal data.</p>
					<h4 class="pp__heading__secondary">What information do we collate</h4>
					<p class="pp__desc">When you interact with one of our services we will have gathered information when you register, when you use our site through cookies or if you choose to reveal information in postings. Please see our Cookie Policy.</p>
					<p class="pp__desc">We may use this information in the following ways to provide our service(s) to you as a user of our sites to enhance your user experience, to carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us, to ensure that content from our sites is presented in the most effective manner for you and your device, to identify you when you visit our sites (including to assist with logging you in), to notify you about changes to our sites, to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our sites.</p>
					<h4 class="pp__heading__secondary">Logging in using social media</h4>
					<p class="pp__desc">If you log-in to our sites using social media, for example Facebook, Google+, Twitter or similar social media platforms, you are granting permission to that social media platform to share your user details with us. This will include your name, email address and date of birth which will then be used to form a user identity. You can also use your picture as part of your profile, though we do require the user pictures not to show inappropriate or graphic images.</p>
					<h4 class="pp__heading__secondary">Registration</h4>
					<p class="pp__desc">The minimum information we need to register you is your name, email address and a password. We will ask you more questions for different services, including sales promotions. Unless we say otherwise, you have to answer all the registration questions.</p>
					<p class="pp__desc">We may also ask some other voluntary questions during registration for certain services (for example, professional networks) so we can gain a clearer understanding of who you are. This also allows us to personalise services for you. After you have registered, we may send you communications we think may interest you in accordance with this information. At any time, you can decide not to receive these communications and will be able to 'unsubscribe' via the link at the bottom of each email.</p>
					<h4 class="pp__heading__secondary">Use of children's data</h4>

					<p class="pp__desc">We may use service providers to help us run these sites (or services available on the sites) . Some of our web pages use plug-ins from other organisations.

					<p class="pp__desc">In the event that we use third party advertisers or sponsors on our sites, we do not disclose identifiable information about individuals, but we may provide them with aggregate information about our users. We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target . We may make use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers' and sponsors' wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience.</p>
					<p class="pp__desc">As you browse our sites, some of the cookies we place on your computer will be advertising cookies, so we can understand what sort of pages you are interested in. We can then display advertising on your browser that is based on these perceived interests.</p>

					<p class="pp__desc">Please note that our sites may from time to time contain links to and from other websites. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites and the information practices of those websites are not covered by this Privacy Policy.
