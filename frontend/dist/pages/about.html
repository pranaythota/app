						<p class="pillars__content__desc">&quot;It is a great privilege to work with Aasya. Aasya was introduced to me by a Cyclothon event which was organized in my college.&quot;</p>
						<p class="pillars__content__desc">&quot;I strongly believe in quote which our great Mahatma Gandhi said "If we wish to create a lasting peace we must begin with the children ". So we started our journey with Udayasri, A nineteen month old girl, who was suffering with cancer. When everyone lost hope, we stood along her side and gave financial support, now she is completely cured. It is neither about treatment given to her nor our financial support. It was all about her battle, which she won against Cancer, heading towards her new life. When someone alone has got the capability to fight against such an evilest thing, together we can do miracles. This paved my way towards the future endeavors of Aasya.&quot;</p>
						<p class="pillars__content__desc">&quot;With the same inspiration we started to expand Aasya Foundation in 2016 to celebrate the beauty of life and to ensure more children like Udayasri are given opportunities to live.&quot;</p>
						<p class="pillars__content__desc">&quot;As progresive step, we are extending our branches in emerging global problems apart from cancer. I envision a world in which everyone can live healthy, productive lives, regardless of who they are (or) where they live.&quot;</p>
						<p class="pillars__content__desc">&quot;Achieving this vision will require a strong effective Aasya that is able to meet emerging challenges and achieve our objectives. We need a Aasya  that is adequately resourced and effectively managed with a strong focus on transparency, accountability and value for money.&quot;</p>

					<p class="brdmembers__article__desc">&quot;I’ve been with Aasya for about 3 yrs. now. Aasya Foundation is not just an Organisation for me anymore, it has become a Family, bundle of Responsibility and Joy. I remember the days we started off with handful of people and now, we are a family of more than 1000 Volunteers.&quot;</p>
					<p class="brdmembers__article__desc">&quot;As the number of volunteers increased we also have expanded our services from raising funds for cancer patients to heart patients and other life threatening health conditions. Also we spend some quality time with Elders in old age homes, orphanages spreading happiness, love and knowing their needs, providing education &amp; financial help to the inaccessible and unaffordable, we also have conducted other events like donating blankets to the poor, food donation campaigns, buttermilk campaigns, free dental camps and many more….&quot;</p>
					<p class="brdmembers__article__desc">&quot;As we are increasing in number not just in Hyderabad, we are now active in 10 other major cities as well. We’ll make sure to come up with many more services to offer, so that we can help more needy people in a short span.&quot;</p>
					<p class="brdmembers__article__desc">&quot;I would let you all know that I have joined Aasya as a volunteer in its budding stage, been a Member of the Board and so on…. It’s been a wonderful journey till date with lots of up’s and Down’s in our way, but we surely enjoyed it coz that is what made Aasya what it is now.&quot;</p>
					<p class="brdmembers__article__desc">&quot;And one thing I’d like to add, We are and Will Strive to be an inspiration, a platform for many who are willing to give their part of service, time and dedication to Serve the Society.&quot;</p>

					<p class="brdmembers__article__desc">&quot;Aasya Foundation provides Health Care services to the underserved people of India.&quot;</p>
					<p class="brdmembers__article__desc">&quot;I, Meghana N, with the recommendation of my friend, joined this organization as a Joint Secretary while I was still pursuing my engineering. The idea of serving the needy and to let myself dissolve in the actions that consequently provide joy to this community, I was moved to join this Non-Profit Organization.&quot;</p>
					<p class="brdmembers__article__desc">&quot;While my way in, I was delighted to meet Mr. Nagarjuna who is the President of this Foundation and the one that shared the vision of his initiatives. A profound leader as he is, not only did he inspired people, he led my spirit to have an absolute zeal towards helping and serving the society.&quot;</p>
					<p class="brdmembers__article__desc">&quot;During my visit to one of Aasya Foundation’s finest events at the Thara Orphanage, where we celebrated our 2nd Anniversary, I met so many children living under the supervision of Vishnu, who also grew up as an orphan in the same orphanage. Seeing them smile for a moment, I could not contemplate how I must feel. Even though they had no parents they were content, playful and happy.&quot;</p>
					<p class="brdmembers__article__desc">&quot;On this day, the kids and I had long chats, we had fun, we studied, and in the afternoon when it was time for lunch, Fruits and chocolates were distributed. We also had a family that visited the orphanage and they wanted to celebrate their child’s birthday. It was a pleasant experience having all these people around but the best part was when the members of Aasya Foundation and I were so engaged in our own responsibilities and duties that we did not realize we haven’t eaten anything since morning until Vishnu came to me offering me a banana. I asked him “If I eat this banana what will you eat then?”&quot;</p>
					<p class="brdmembers__article__desc">&quot;He replied softly “Sister, the way you treated us with so much love and patience today, I haven’t felt or seen it before. I see my mother in you. You treated me and the others like your own kids”&quot;</p>
					<p class="brdmembers__article__desc">&quot;I had no words. This child just entitled me as his mother. My heart was filled with a vague feeling of accomplishment that I didn’t understand. And ever since I rejoice this moment.&quot;</p>
					<p class="brdmembers__article__desc">&quot;I told Vishnu that it was the best thing I have ever heard. I replied to him saying ‘I will always love you kid and we will miss you’ and he cutely replied back saying “me too”&quot;</p>
					<p class="brdmembers__article__desc">&quot;Gazing at his expression my eyes were blurred with droplets of tears and I couldn’t have felt happier from that day onward. It was literally the best moment of my life.&quot;</p>
					<p class="brdmembers__article__desc">&quot;And then while we departed, he insisted that I visit the orphanage again with my team, to spend time with the children and while we were leaving, he started crying&quot;</p>
					<p class="brdmembers__article__desc">&quot;Honestly, of all the relations with people in this country, the bond with Vishnu was realest and officially the best since date. I want to go back!&quot;</p>
