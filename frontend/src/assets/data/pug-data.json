Also we spend some quality time with Elders in old age homes, orphanages spreading happiness, love and knowing their needs, providing education & financial help to the inaccessible and unaffordable, we also have conducted other events like donating blankets to the poor, food donation campaigns, buttermilk campaigns, free dental camps and many more….",

Seeing them smile for a moment, I could not contemplate how I must feel. Even though they had no parents they were content, playful and happy.",

It was a pleasant experience having all these people around but the best part was when the members of Aasya Foundation and I were so engaged in our own responsibilities and duties that we did not realize we haven’t eaten anything since morning until Vishnu came to me offering me a banana. I asked him “If I eat this banana what will you eat then?”",

I used to think of being passionate about service, but now I am so grateful to work with people, whose passion is all about service. My experience in Aasya from past one year made me to be strong in and out, helped me to increase my dedication levels, team spirit, ethical values and leadership qualities. I used to fell myself for tiny problems. But, after going through the fades of many life shadows. I made myself strong enough to face any situation..!! If I could sum up my experience in Aasya, I would say that it was a life changing step of mine."

We also had a family that visited the orphanage and they wanted to celebrate their child’s birthday. It was a pleasant experience having all these people around but the best part was when the members of Aasya Foundation and I were so engaged in our own responsibilities and duties that we did not realize we haven’t eaten anything since morning until Vishnu came to me offering me a banana. I asked him “If I eat this banana what will you eat then?”",
